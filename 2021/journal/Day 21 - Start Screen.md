# Day 21 - Start Screen

The Start screen appears before the game starts. There are two ways I can handle it. I could use HTML and render text/button. Or I could do everything in the canvas element.

Because the canvas element is positioned in the center of the screen at a fixed size, it will take some CSS to position an HTML overlay. Bytes that might not be needed. If I used the canvas and drawText, none of that HTML and CSS will be needed. Plus I can re-use the animation generators.
