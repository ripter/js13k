# Day 20

There is only 12 days left in js13k, so I need to wrap this up. For such a simple game, it has taken me a long time to build it. I only get a couple of hours to work on it a day. If I was able to spend an entire day I could probably get a lot more done, but that hasn't been possible. I have a 6 month old baby and a full time job. So week days I'm lucky to get two hours, and the weekend I'm lucky to get a couple of hours while the wife and baby nap. My wife often works on the weekend, so she gets four or five hours to focus and work, while I take care of the baby.

What do we have right now? The gameis 6,123 bytes out of 13,312 bytes. So we still have 7,189 bytes left to finish the game. 

Single level with randomly places trash blocks. The blocks can be put into the compactor. When the user presses the button, it compacts the trash and updates the score. So what do we still need?

* Updated Graphics.
* Sound effects and music.
* Fix trash placement and number of random trash pieces.
* Start Screen with How to Play and Story Info.
* End Screen with High Score and a replay option.

Updating the graphics and fixing the bugs will take very few of the remaining bytes. The Start and End screens probably won't take up too much space either. THat leaves the majority of the remaining 7KB for sound effects and music.

As far as what will take up the most time, the Sound/Music and updated graphics will take me the longest to complete. I'm not good at those tasks. The bug fix and screens will be the quickest to complete. So that means I should spend the rest of my week days on those tasks, while leaving the harder tasks to the weekend where I have more time.
