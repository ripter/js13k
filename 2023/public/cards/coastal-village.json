  "name": "Coastal Village",
  "description": "Nestled along the shimmering embrace of the Mediterranean coast, the Coastal Village offers a refuge amidst the tumultuous Crusader campaign. Wooden piers extend into azure waters, where fishing boats sway in tandem with the gentle waves. Whitewashed stone cottages huddle together, their thatched roofs crowned by plumes of smoke. Weathered faces, etched by both time and toil, greet weary Crusaders with cautious curiosity. The village exudes an air of weary resilience, caught between the crossroads of war and the tranquil cadence of daily life.",
