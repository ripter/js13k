        <p>🎲 On your turn, you pick a challenge from the card pool. Your aim is to either match or surpass the challenge's 🏰 Strength value by rolling two six-sided dice (2d6).</p>
        <p>💡 To enhance your odds, you can spend resources like 🛡️ Army, 🏇 Cavalry, or 📿 Monks. These can be used to decrease the challenge's 🏰 Strength, giving you a better chance to overcome it.</p>
