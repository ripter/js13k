        <h3>JS13k 2023 - Theme: 13th Century</h3>
        <p>The 13th Century: A time when kingdoms rose and fell on the whispers of courtiers and the bravery of knights. In this age of chivalry, legends spoke of the Sacred Four: ancient and mystical items of immense power - the 🏆 Grail, 🗡️ Shard, 💎 Stone, and the revered 📜 Manuscript.</p>
        <p>In <b>Quest for the Sacred Four</b>, you and your opponent are rival leaders racing against time and each other to be the first to gather these four revered items. Deploy your 🛡️ Army, command your 🏇 Cavalry, and seek guidance from your 📿 Monks to challenge and weaken the 🏰 Strength that guards the treasures. The more you diminish the challenge's strength, the higher your chances of claiming a sacred item. But tread carefully, for the path is treacherous and your opponent is always on the lookout for a chance to outwit you.</p>

        <p>🎲 On your turn, you pick a challenge from the card pool. Your aim is to either match or surpass the challenge's 🏰 Strength value by rolling two six-sided dice (2d6).</p>
        <p>💡 To enhance your odds, you can spend resources like 🛡️ Army, 🏇 Cavalry, or 📿 Monks. These can be used to decrease the challenge's 🏰 Strength, giving you a better chance to overcome it.</p>
        <p>🏆 The first player to collect all four Sacred artifacts emerges victorious in their quest!</p>
