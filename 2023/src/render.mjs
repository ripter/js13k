/**
 * Triggers Render on all the elements. 
 * Why a render function and pasing state? Why not pass everything as attributes?
 * A few reasons, attribute values are stringified, which is annoying to work with and ineffecent. 
 * Also, I don't want to waste bytes dealing with it. This uses fewer bytes than the alternative.
 * If this bothers you, then you can think of this as a stupid verion of an <App /> component found in react projects.
