### Prerequisites

- You need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) installed.

## TL;DR
```bash
make
```
That will build from source, and then start the server.

### Building & Zipping

```bash
make build
```

### Start server


```bash
make server
```

This will setup a server listening at `http://localhost:8080/`.
